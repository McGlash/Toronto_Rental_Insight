Toronto Rental Insight

Visual Design of Dashboard

The dashboard will consist of map and a sidebar. 

Map

The leaflet library will be used to display a map of Toronto with FSA boundaries outlined. By default, the map will show markers for the daily rental postings. The map will include a toggle bar that will enable users to add/remove markers for:
* Rental postings
* Community assets
* Crime incidence (past 6 months).   

Sidebar

There will be three versions of the sidebar based on how they interact with the map.

Click on Rental Posting Marker
* Rental posting details
* Bar chart of average income with FSA compared to Toronto overall
* Heat map of Toronto showing crime incidence

Click on Community Asset Marker
* Community Asset information 

Click on FSA

The sidebar will have buttons to toggle views between crime data and rental posting data.

Rental posting data
* bar graph displaying average cost to rent in FSA (data scrapped that day) by number of bedrooms.
* line graph displaying average to rent in FSA over time (historical/trending data) by number of bedrooms.
