A central connection between Harbourfront, the Entertainment District, and King and Queen West, it\u2019s the new destination for those who believe in a life balanced between cosmopolitan intrigue, abundant nature, and close-knit community. The Bathurst streetcar will provide you with quick access to GO Trains, the Harbourfront and Union Station. With the City of Toronto investing millions into Fort York, the rebirth of this district will be remarkable.\n\nAbout Historic Fort York Park:\n\nThis 32-acre National Historic Site, complete with vast tracts of lush parkland, is now poised to reclaim its place as a centre piece of the city. With revitalization plans that include a new Visitor\u2019s Centre and a proposed pedestrian bridge, the historic Fort York \u2014 and its 32 acres of permanently protected green space will be even more attractive as a welcoming neighbor and community treasure.\n\nPrime location: Just steps to lakeshore and minutes to major highways! (Gardiner expressway, QEW, 401)\n\nAll utilities included except hydro. Locker included. No parking. Plenty of parking spots are available for rent in the the building and in surrounding area.","furnished":null,"id":"c_7202339137","image":"https://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_a1cOL5WCXjO_04Q02J_600x450.jpg","lat":43.6404,"long":-79.3995,"pet_friendly":false,"post_published_date":"2020-09-24","postal_code":"M5V 0E4","price":1950,"rental_type":"condo","source":"craigslist","sqft":612.0,"title":"LUXURY APARTMENT WITH UPGRADES - 1 BEDROOM, DEN IN DOWNTOWN TORONTO","url":"https://toronto.craigslist.org/tor/apa/d/downtown-toronto-luxury-apartment-with/7202339137.html"},{"FSA":"M5V","bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":1.0,"description":"1BR / 1Ba available now condo w/d in unit/ 1br -Available immediately\nUnfurnished\nUnder 700 square feet\nLocker included\nBalcony\n\nExceptional 1 Bedroom Condo Now Available In The Entertainment District.
