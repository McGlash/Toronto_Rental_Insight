We are looking for two people to fill two (separate) fully furnished bedrooms in our communally-minded vegan home in the Roncesvalles neighbourhood. Both rooms are upstairs with a shared bathroom. Master and smaller mint room are available Sept. 1st.

price: $950 per month (for master), $ 750 per month (for mint room) plus all utilities for $120 per month, including internet.

location: Dundas and Sorauren, near Dundas West Station (heart of Roncesvalles).

lease terms: This is a roommate search and rent will be paid to the leaseholder (Caitlin, another roomie, not the house owner) on a month to month basis, with a minimum of three months commitment to start.

required documents for application:
· References (ideally from previous landlord)
· First and last month's rent.

additional info:
Two of our roomies had to move to be with family due to covid-related issues, and we are still looking for the ideal fit for our communally-minded Victorian home in the heart of Roncesvalles. We love to cook and share meals together in an atmosphere of conscious care. It’s a vegan home (no animal-based foods) and we’re committed to principals of radical softness and contextual wisdom, so shared values and like-minded folks are important. And we’re more than happy to help those interested in learning how to cook yummy plant based meals at home - we tend to share groceries as well. The master room features a beautiful bay windows outlooking the street, extra high ceilings, and a calming drift wood light fixture (as pictured). The mint room is very small but has two teak shelves mounted with a clothing rack, small desk and double bed. It feels super cozy and warm and gets the best light in the whole house. It has a south facing window which looks out to our lovely backyard.

a little bit about us:
Caitlin is a 36-year-old queer curator and performance maker that runs a little shop on Dundas St. West, plays Maracatu, and is passionate about social justice through art and collaborative visioning. I am 28 and work as a gardener full-time and am really passionate about music. I will be going back to school in the fall to study Social Work. Cleanliness is super important to us, so we are looking for people that are proactive about keeping common areas clean and can help out with weekly chores. We see great value in communal living, and are looking for folks who feel similarly about creating a supportive shared space. Capacity to communicate openly and with maturity is essential.

preferred method of contact: Please email me (Matt) with any inquiries along with your name and number and a little bit about what you’re looking for along with a comment here if you’re interested!",craigslist

There are total of three bedrooms on the 2nd floor of the house. I use one of them; however, I'm mostly away because I work abroad. I'm looking for trustworthy, clean, responsible and respectful tenants to rent the room.

Since I'm not living there most of the time, tenants are expected to do light maintenance outside place. Sidewalk in front of the house is shoveled by the city so there is only minor shoveling involved.

Reasonable usage of the utilities is included. Contact me with text or WhatsApp if you're interested and tell me a little bit about yourself.

The room in the picture will be rented out. Bed looks slightly different and it's positioned differently. The wall between the kitchen and the dinning room is now gone.

Rental amount could possibly be negotiable if you do not require parking with the condo.

Move into this suite with brand new top quality eco hardwood laminate floors, installed in 2019 that are not in the photographs yet. This sprawling 1,025 square foot corner suite features soaring windows on two sides, 1 bedroom, 1 bath, easy breezy kitchen, open concept Great Room, ensuite laundry. Most impressive of all - a 1000 square foot bonus outdoor living space - a stunning terrace landscaped with cherry trees, lilacs, peonies, boxwood, and tulips! This terrace is totally private for your exclusive enjoyment. The bedroom features a plush, supportive CALIFORNIA KING size mattress and plenty of storage space. Ideally suited for an executive rental or couple that loves upscale living.

The prestigious Ramsden building is across the intersection from the leafy green Rosedale TCC Subway stop - literally a 3 min walk. The building is mid-rise, with a limited number of suites per floor, so not a high-density building with high traffic and noise pollution. For a building in the heart of midtown, it is surprisingly serene. There is a precious residential integrity to this place that is hard to find anywhere else. The Ramsden is 90% owner-occupied, so there is not that transient feeling of living in a skyscraper.

Former tenants rave about the joys of a sprawling PRIVATE green space, and a bedroom that feels like a REAL, proper bedroom, not a poor excuse for a den or what passes for a bedroom in new build, cookie-cutter condos in the GTA.

Finding a rental unit at this building is rare! A very different feel to the “pack them in like sardines” vibe of the majority of GTA condos. A peaceful residential community, perfect for commuters who need quick access to the Yonge subway line.

Top-notch WALK SCORE to nearby amenities and attractions - stroll to the global flagship Four Seasons Toronto, Royal Ontario Museum, the Mink Mile of haute shops like Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Cartier in under 15 minutes. Looking for a mindful, respectful tenant to enjoy the lifestyle here. Perfect for Yorkville, Rosedale, Terroni and Summerhill LCBO enthusiasts - it's time to pop the bubbly on this terrace overlooking Rosedale!

You will have exclusive, private, ""whole house"" use of the condo, with no shared rooms or bath. There is a shared building rooftop terrace to gather with neighbors and additional building amenities include a FITNESS GYM, party room, and 24-Hour Security.

A bright, recently renovated (2016) first floor studio/1 bedroom apartment with a reserved portion of the front patio facing a quiet street. This apartment is the first floor of a multi-floor detached home. The unit has a full kitchen with fridge, gas stove and microwave. There are windows in each room making it a very bright and pleasant space. To maintain the openness of the space, there are no doors in the doorways separating the kitchen, bedroom or living room. Between the bedroom and living room space, there is a curtain. If you'd like to add doors, you can discuss this option with the owner. The bathroom has a bathtub with shower. There are 2 built in closet spaces for general storage. Economical everyday use of the utilities is calculated at about ~$100/person/month*. (*The cost of utilities may be higher if usage is above average.)

This home is steps away from so many great spots on the West side of downtown Toronto. To the South you are less than a 10 minute walk from the water. To the North you can explore the King West and Queen West restaurants, shopping and night life. To the East you can stroll over to Liberty Village. To the West you can enjoy High Park and Roncesvalles. In terms of transport you are 1 minute from the TTC's Dufferin Streetcar Loop where you can easily travel North on Dufferin and East or West on King St. There is no parking on the premise but you can get a monthly pass from the City of Toronto for overnight city parking. Since you're in the city, if you like to walk or bike, you're less than 20 minutes away from most of life's day to day conveniences. And for those rainy/lazy days, you have access to quick/regular Uber or Lyft rides! The pictures are all from June 2020 with the current tenant's furniture/decor to give you a sense of how things could fit.",craigslist

This space is unlike anything you would have seen in Toronto. It's the 3rd floor attic space of a home, on a quiet street just West of the downtown core, with a view of the CN Tower! If you are looking for a space that is not your typical cookie cutter condo, if you like spaces with a lot of character, and are a minimalist... then this space is for you!!!

Good for 2 people to share the unit with one bedroom each, but ideal for a single person/couple to have a 1 bedroom with a living room. Within this space are 2 rooms, a full kitchen with gas stove, fridge and microwave. It's a bright space with lots of natural light thanks to 2 skylights in each bedroom and a large private balcony/patio. Use of the washer/dryer in the unit is included for up to 4 hours per week. Economical everyday use of the utilities is calculated at about ~$100/person/month*. (*The cost of utilities may be higher if usage is above average.) Air conditioning during the months of May to September is available upon request for an additional $50/month.

The bathroom is the only aspect that may take a little getting used to. In order to create a fully independent apartment, the bathroom is designed as a very small water closet with a toilet, sink and shower head all in the same space. Basically... imagine an airplane washroom with a shower-head in the ceiling. Like I said... you must be a minimalist to appreciate the space.

In terms of Location, you are steps from Liberty Village to the East, the Waterfront to the South, High Park and Roncesvalles to the West and the unique vibe of King West and Queen West to the North. You are well connected to many conveniences by walk or bike, only a minute away from buses and streetcars and plenty of Uber/Lyft rides in the area within minutes.",craigslist

Hello all, I am looking to sublet my beautiful apt in the Forest Hill, Up-Town area. Due to the time I spend outside of Toronto, I am looking for someone to call it home for the time being (as listed above). The current subletor has decided to move in with their partner, hence the reason I need to sublet it once again. The location is amazing; it is a less than 10 min walk from Yonge and Eglinton, where you will find the Rio Centre all types of restaurants, shops, grocery store, Eglington subway station, North Toronto Community Centre, etc. There are also many shops and restaurants right by Eglinton and Avenue.

TERM: Roommate agreement - long term preferred.

ACCESS INFO: Stairs at front of the house - steep staircase to basement inside house.

THE HOUSE: without a doubt this is my favourite house I’ve ever lived in! We get the main floor of the house, a beautiful fenced off backyard with a picnic bench, and the basement which includes the bathroom, a giant storage room, and little laundry room. The landlord, who is a straight up angel who helps with everything immediately always, lives upstairs. House is located in Parkdale right near Queen and Dufferin, 7 min walk away from metro and freshco.

THE BEDROOM: It’s small but lovely. The bedroom has a screen door that leads to the backyard. This was my bedroom for 2 years and I straight up woke up every morning feeling like snow white looking out at the yard with the greenery and birds/squirrels! When I had this bedroom I was able to fit in a queen sized bed and dresser + other storage items. If you need more space than the room provides, you can always use the storage room downstairs. The floor is dingy looking from previous paint jobs, when I had the room most of it was covered with furniture and the rest I covered in carpet. I pay more rent since my bedroom is bigger.

ME: I’m a 28yo gal and work full time as a social worker. I’m fairly introverted and quiet and I’d say overall a chill roommate to have.

YOU: similar age/lifestyle/vibe/work schedule to me, are reasonably tidy, like cats, do not have your own pets - (my cat doesn't get along with others), and are covid conscious

Our current roommate is a super cool online marketer who has lived here for 2.5 years an is moving into a really great deal of a one bedroom apartment on Sept 1, so the room will be empty Sept 2nd for moving in. (Date might be negotiable for a little later into September.)

Utilities included in the $925 rent. This includes hydro and unlimited internet.

The room is located on the second floor, it is the biggest room in the house, it is well lit and a large window of the street. There is a closet in the room. The room comes unfurnished.

Looking for working person or student, first and last required, no smoking inside the house. The house isn't pet-friendly, unfortunately, but there's a dog next door that is quite friendly once you get to know him. The laundry is in the back of the house. LGBT friendly.

Other tenants are 2 friendly, relatively quiet guys in their 30s, and a female in her mid-20s. All of us work 9-5 for the most part, and because of the pandemic, are working a mix between at home and in the office, so you would have to be ok with seeing a lot of everyone and regular noise (zoom meetings, cooking, etc.) on a daily basis. We will have dinners occasionally here with friends or each other, or sit out on the front porch in the summer, etc. We all respect each other's privacy, but happy to hang out if the mood strikes us. This would be a good place to live if you're looking friendly working types who are tidy and keep a fairly regular schedule during the week.

The apartment building is only 4 stories.

I am looking for one new roommate this time. Ideal age range between 30-40. Female or Male. We've had both.

The two recent females who lived here, were on Work Permits which expired a few months ago.

Please read all the info over before you reply. If you'd like a reply, please answer our posted questions in detail.

As we are in times of COVID..there are a few extra steps we all must take.

Perhaps you are new to Canada and/or just starting out..You are in a good ""head space"", bring positivity, and have experience living with others.

You have your own bedroom things and other personal items.

The bedroom space is 9ft X 11ft, with a large 3ft X 4ft walk-in closet. Best suits a double bed.

Along Bloor West, there is one apartment building (used to be a hotel) which overlooks High Park...just one block away. I am right beside High Park, south side of Bloor. Very quiet, no subway noise or road traffic.

Excellent heritage building, responsible building management. Shared clean washroom/excellent water pressure, new washer/dryer in unit. Clean. Bright. Quiet. Large Balcony facing south towards Lake Ontario and High Park

Awesome view (like a tree house). 3rd floor private balcony. 1200 sq ft. inside, 100 sq ft outside.

High Park location is 20 minutes on subway from Yonge/Bloor, 4-5km if walking
There is street parking only (permit), should you own a vehicle.

For us there now, it is a bit of private retreat after long work days. A VERY quiet and clean space.

Apartment and area must be seen, usual size bedrooms, closets in each one. I'm not providing tons of pictures because they don't do justice to the space. If you are serious about the location, and know the High Park area, then this is the first step. Reach out. Best viewed in person if we get that far.

Your reply to me is important.

If you are looking to live beside a 400-acre park, this is the place! This is your backyard. Fresh air and privacy.
The green spacepark we spend time in has been incredible during these last 4 months.

Two blocks is library, food, lcbo, shoppers drug mart, running room, bike stores, coffee shops, bakeries etc

I am looking for ONE new roommate. Rent is $800 month all in. (although monthly shared supplies are about $20 each). First and last required, although not at same time, 7 days apart.

We have one tv (basic channels), and unlimited internet plan.

Non-smokers only, no smoking/vaping of any kind/no exceptions, and no pets. (its in my lease)

Ideal qualities..working in creative industries, arts/culture lover, physically active (runner/cyclist), stable, professional, respectful, mature, responsible, QUIET, passionate about what you do, HAS LIVED WITH PEOPLE BEFORE, may have some furnishings to bring. We all live together and respect others personal space, everything reasonable shared, chores split equally...this is important..

If you are just looking for a ""room"", this probably is not the right space for you.

Pls tell me a bit about yourself. Where do live now? Why do you need to move? Why High Park? Where do you work/what do you do...If you are serious about this posting, answering these questions are important. We are not in a huge rush, but will act with the right person.

The ""right person"" for us will also have a recent 'negative' Covid test, or be willing to get one before moving in. No exceptions, as we've made great sacrifices here to keep the place Healthy

We do not wish to waste anyone's time, nor our's etc. If you are contacting us, please know where High Park is and how it may impact your commute (based on where you are now)",craigslist

## Sublet details

Hi there,

We are offering our beautiful and spacious Victorian home for sublet from November 26-7 1st, 2020 to February 28th, 2021 (3 months in total).
The apartment includes the lower two floors of a 4 stories gorgeous Victorian house (only the entrance is shared with upstairs neighbours).
The space includes a spacious bedroom and living room, a dining area, a kitchen, two working areas, a powder room, a bathroom (with a shower, and a bath tub),
a private balcony (with BBQ) in a private backyard, and a shared front porch,.

The sublet includes fully suited house, ready to be used, including towels/beddings, high speed internet, washer/dryer/dishwasher (private, and inside the house), and plenty of storage rooms. We will collect our belongings into the den in the lower floor, so you will have access to many of the storage spaces.å

The house is very spacious, with high ceiling, a stained-glass window, and a very unique atmosphere. The backyard also has BBQ (though weather might be too cold).
The house is located in Cabbage town (walking distance to central downtown Toronto, 15 min walk from Dundas Square), surrounded by stores, restaurants, coffee houses, public parks, and public transportation nearby.

We are looking for a renter that will keep our place in good conditions (couples will get priority, we rather avoid roommates but will consider exceptions).

- The first 5 pictures show your private bedroom and bathroom. The rest are for shared areas. You are looking at a place that rivals any luxurious vacation home yet in the most desirable area within walking distance everywhere.

A female is preferred. Must be a tidy, clean college student or professional.
No smoking, no pets, no parties, no frequent guest overnights.

$1185/month all-inclusive: rent, heat, water, laundry (washer & dryer), unlimited top-speed WFI.
Available September 2nd (flexible starting date). My cell is show contact info . Feel free to text or call anytime. Thank you, Susan",craigslist

This is an eclectic group, we do not eat communally as most work and go to school on erratic schedules
We are thoughtful and hate drama... I live on-site so any problems are dealt with quickly
This is a family home and as such our pets wander freely... no place for you if you are allergic

There are very few rules, but necessary to run a home with very different personalities

I do not ask for utilities a connection, there is a connection fee for the wifi this is a one time fee of $25 and we share the fee for a cleaning lady once a week for the main areas Bath/kitchen etc


Rent is due 1 business day before the first (or before the holiday weekends) by direct transfer... Cash is fine though


If you feel you can still agree to this... I can arrange a viewing after this weekend... there is a lot of interest so I will tell you now after first and last... The ability to get along will decide if I rent to you.

We are on a blue Line for buses and within walking distance of Dundas West Stn also a short bus ride from Keele
a great shopping area with almost anything you may need.
On offer is our student room, some furniture change may be necessary.

The photo showing the bed is actually the living room area. The photo showing the rug is the bedroom itself. And the checkered floors are no longer in the bathroom; it has a new neutral tile now.

his stunner at 6 Winnifred Ave is fully done to the 11s from top to bottom. There is not one atom in this house that hasn’t been thoroughly investigated and updated. Gracious main floor layout beckons you inside to bright, open concept living and guides you towards the back of the house. So many built-ins I lost count because most of them are so well integrated you almost don’t realize they are there (blink and you’ll miss the main floor powder room). Stunning chef’s kitchen with gas range, pot filler, Touch20 faucet and coziest breakfast nook EVER. Arrive at the top of the stairs bathed in light from the skylight above. Three bedrooms (more built-ins here everyone), and a great, family sized bathroom. Basement has been dug down (ceilings are 8′!) and is its own fabulous suite (same level of finish as the rest) with separate entrance",craigslist

Long-term preferred.

DUE TO COVID: We greatly appreciate someone who has been and continues to be, careful with social distancing, masks etc. outside the home. As we have vulnerable people in our family, we are careful and get tested (nearby testing centre that takes about 10 minutes), and encourage you do so as well. Please wear a mask and disinfect hands!
Bright, private second floor room for rent in shared home (myself, teen-aged daughter and son (my son has his own basement room/washroom) and one lovely tenant/friend. Please note: this is SINGLE room but has bunk beds; commonly used for storage/hanging clothes. Handy! : ) )
Shared full washroom with one other tenant.
Because there are young women living on the second floor, we prefer to keep male house guests on the main floor only. (sorry)
Shared use of kitchen and rest of house (including back yard and porch).
Friendly, quiet street in beautiful, safe Riverdale neighbourhood, but minutes from downtown hub.
Conveniently located within walking distance to Pape station and 506 street cars, No Frills and Foodland grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants, cafes, great parks (Withrow and RIverdale), libraries etc.
Situated between eclectic East Chinatown and the vibrant Greek Village; wonderful for all kinds of shopping and eating!
Easy TTC ride to George Brown, U of T, etc., also Brickworks, the Beaches, and Lesieville (15 minute walk) and downtown.
Looking for a (relatively) quiet, friendly, no-drama and busy/private woman; because this is family-style home, privacy and mutual respect is a must.

*Must be okay with pets; we have a very well-behaved dog and two cats.

If interested, please reply with a little information about yourself.

Thanks for taking a look!

I'm looking for a housemate to share the upper portion (second floor and converted attic) of a home in the Beaches. Available from August 20th onward.

The person who rents this space will have two rooms available, each about 9' x 11' (280 x 330), with West-facing windows, on the second floor of the house. (Please note, however, that this rental is only available to one other person, per the landlord's rules.)

It has a shared kitchen, bathroom, and some common areas. There's lots of storage, with an ensuite washer and dryer. Utilities are included.

(There was cleaner who came on a bi-weekly schedule for some light cleaning, but they have not been in since Covid-19 started. This may one day resume, but who knows when that might be.)

Internet costs would be shared, if you intend to use it.

The house has central air, and the rooms that are available tend to stay pretty cool in the summer months, and warm in the winter as a result.

No dishwasher, but there's a sink! (Haha.) Fully furnished kitchen, including toaster oven and microwave. Possibly overly furnished.

Apartment is non-smoking, and no pets (due to allergies). LGBTQIA friendly. (I'm male, in case that factors into your considerations.)

Need to be able to do stairs, as the apartment is on the second level of the house.

There is a deck, as well as a charcoal barbecue.

I tend to have a variable schedule, so someone who isn't going to be woken up by my walking around would likely have the best experience.

Asking for half of the $1800 total rent, which is $900/month.",craigslist

About Us - Two 30-something working professionals + a cat

N works in construction as a finish carpenter, so he generally works long days and you probably won't see much of him during the week. He is spatially creative, extremely helpful and generous. Need something built? He can do that!

L works from home as a graphic designer, and has some other creative endeavours on the side. She enjoys cooking/collaborations and is working on expanding her potted plant family.

Calvin is a sweet mild-mannered tuxedo boy who works for treats, but doesn't have to work for the pets -- he's so soft, you'll find it hard to keep your hands away!

Since we will also be moving into this place on September 1, this will be a fresh opportunity to curate a home to suit everyone's needs. Reply with a little about yourself, and we will set up interviews/viewings, thank you!",craigslist

1 bedroom for rent in an apartment in the heart of Bloordale (Bloor and Dufferin).

Me: Elementary school teacher who loves to cook! I love this house and neighbourhood, and get enjoyment from having a nice place to call home. I’m looking for someone to live with that is chill, friendly, tidy, respectful, and wouldn’t mind living with a cat.

You: Looking for a great place to live, with lots of space and a chill roommate! This place is unique because it's so big, you don't feel like you're living in someone else's space.

What's Nearby

With a home at 33 Charles Street you will be living right next to one of Toronto's most popular intersections. The Yonge and Bloor neighbourhood offers an exciting mosaic of the downtown living experience, with the central TTC junction pulling it all together. You will enjoy a smooth blend of business, fashion, artistry, and entertainment, from Yonge Street nightlife and cultural events to Bloor Street restaurants and cafes, Yorkville boutique shopping, and Bay Street business bustle.

Discover the Royal Ontario Museum, the Toronto Reference Library, the Eaton Centre, plus a variety of cinemas, theatres, and art galleries. A few local gems to check out include Sassafraz Restaurant on Cumberland Street for an evening cocktail and appetizers in the piano lounge, Spring Rolls on Yonge Street, and Focaccia on Hayden Street for a refined Italian spot with fixed-price dinners.

For all your local groceries visit Longo's at Hudson's Bay Centre on Bloor Street, Valu-Mart at Bloor and Bay Street, and No Frills at Saks Market on Bloor just west of Sherbourne Street.

Casa Condos is right beside George Hislop Park, as well as within walking distance to Queens Park, a popular tree-filled spot perfect for jogging, roller-blading, outdoor workouts, or simply sitting in the shade with a book.

Getting Around

The Yonge and Bloor area has a 100 Walk Score, with nearby bicycle-friendly lanes on Wellesley, College, and Sherbourne Streets. If you want to travel fast, the main hub of Toronto's TTC network is right at Bloor and Yonge, giving you access to the whole city.

Character of Ossington Village

 At its south end, Ossington starts at Queen Street and goes north, up a hill to Dundas Street. This area is a newly developing and vibrant part of town undergoing tremendous transition.

 From this intersection north to Dundas, Ossington is largely lined with low-rise retail storefronts. Most buildings along this stretch date to the 19th century, and many have been restored in their conversion into restaurants and trendy stores, which have attracted visitors from around the Greater Toronto Area and made the area a magnet for international tourists visiting Toronto.

 The Neighbourhood — above Queen up to Harrison, across Crawford out past Dovercourt — a place of creativity and tradition, leafiness and urbanity, density with breathing room, diversity with congeniality — efficient, convenient, walkable, replete with classic Toronto Victorian architecture and prized gardens — clean, safe, friendly, fun, supportive of all ages, backgrounds, lifestyles.

 The Ossington Strip — Toronto’s restaurant row, a city-wide destination distinctively prized for high-quality eclecticism — emerging from the entrepreneurial energy of the Strip’s business community — sustained by the Strip’s openness to the sky, its low-key, funky, intimate built form — fueled by visitors and residents on the Strip for relaxation, mystery, surprise, the latest, the artisanal, the funnest, the coolest. Restaurant Row intermingles here on the town square with providers for car, soul, body, wardrobe, house, health, business, mind, eye, garden.

 The Dundas Bend — a quirky segment of one of Toronto’s great corridors — a corridor stretching northwest through Beaconsfield, Davenport, Roncesvalles, the Junction, and beyond; leading east past beautiful Trinity-Bellwoods Park, Kensington, Chinatown, through the heart of Downtown, and over the Don River out to the Beach — with a vibrant mix of locally-owned main street businesses and restaurants.

 For more information about Ossington Village’s restaurants, festivals, nightlife, theatre and art, please visit: http://ossingtonvillage.com


Trinity Bellwoods Park – is a site for many cultural events, including a bookfair, live theatre, performance art, informal summer drumming circles, and features the Trinitiy Bellwoods Farmers Market (www.tbfm.ca).

The alleys and laneways which surround Trinity Bellwoods park have become an impromptu art gallery open to the public for one weekend in August for the past four years: Alley Jaunt.

Description:
The King Charlotte By Lamb Development. Ultra Chic Luxury One Bedroom Suite. Great views as there are no building(s) In Front Of You!!!

Perfect One-Bedroom Layout! With A Crazy Oversized Balcony And Unobstructed North Views From the 15th Floor. Floor To Ceiling Windows With Roller Shades. Stainless Steel Appliances With Gas Cooking Inside And On Balcony For Bbq. Rooftop Gym And Outdoor Pool. 24 Hour Concierge. Unobstructed View Of The City. Quick Walk To King St And Queen St Shopping And 24 Hour Public Transit.

Included:
Premium Stainless Steel Appliances. (Fridge, Gas Range, Dishwasher, Microwave/Range Hood).
Stacked Washer/Dryer in unit
Roller Blinds.

Those who plan to commute by bicycle can store their vehicles in the building’s bike parking, while residents who love playing host can invite friends and family to gather in the party room whenever the mood strikes. And just to make life a little easier, there’s a 24-hour concierge and security onsite.

Kitchens boast European-style cabinetry, stainless steel appliances, and stone countertops, and some even feature islands; bathrooms are finished with porcelain tiles

Residents living at 11 Charlotte can also head up to Queen West to visit its eclectic range of shops — from brand name stores to locally-run vintage boutiques — or its equally assorted variety of restaurants. And Chinatown begins on Spadina Avenue, just north of Queen, where everything from late-night dim sum to inexpensive housewares can be found.

As far as groceries go, residents of the King Charlotte Condos can walk just 2 minutes in order to reach the Fresh; Wild Food Market at the corner of King and Spadina (or the LCBO right across the street). Alternatively, an enormous Loblaws is a 12-minute walk away, at Queen and Portland.

Transportation
Living in the core of the city means owning a car is definitely optional. Those living at the King Charlotte Condos can walk just one block in order to reach stops for the King and Spadina streetcars, which carry passengers east and west or north and south, respectively. St. Andrew Station is also only 10 minutes away by foot, from which trains head north and south throughout the city.

Those who prefer to drive, on the other hand, are equally well situated. Drivers living at 11 Charlotte can access the Gardiner Expressway in no time, and from there a connection to the Don Valley Parkway or the 427 is quick and painless.

One of our roommates is moving out of the country, so we’re looking for a new kind, communicative, and anti-oppressive roommate to join our communal home in the heart of Roncesvalles on August 15 or September 1! The house has a beautiful front porch and yard, and is equipped with a washer and dryer in the basement. It is less than a minute from Roncesvalles Avenue, and ~10 minutes to High Park and the lake. Internet is included, utilities are extra (usually ~$20-$70 a month, depending on the season).

Ideally, we’re looking for someone who is easy-going, communicative, and kind, and understands our house values. If you’re politically left, anti-capitalist, environmentally-friendly, and anti-oppressive (BLM and decolonial, and absolutely NO racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and all the other icky -isms and phobias) you will probably be a great fit! Must love dogs as we have a pup here :))))

Here’s who’d you be living with:

- she/her, mid-twenties, works from home for a feminist health non-profit. Into nature, intersectional feminism, yoga, slow fashion, pleasure activism, potlucks with pals, environmentalism, and crafts. No cops, terfs, or swerfs please :))))
- he/him, mid-twenties, songwriter/performer, working for a craft brewery (usually not from home). Avid reader, film consumer, nature/outdoors enthusiast, vegan food lover and environmental activist.
- he/him, late twenties, bi/pansexual supply chain/logistics professional. Avid writer and reader, lover of all things film and music, nature enthusiast, vegan food lover and aspiring civil rights & environmental activist focused on Indigenous voices in Canada.

In the house we enjoy sharing vegan meals together, and contribute to everyday necessities (currently everyone puts in $40 a week for 3-4 shared meals and necessities like toilet paper, laundry detergent, cleaning supplies, etc). Unfortunately no cats due to allergies! Please tell us about yourself (the more the better) and we’ll be in touch! MUST BE FOLLOWING ALL COVID-19 HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS!",craigslist

ABOUT ME: I'm currently only working a couple of times a week, but will be looking for a new job/possibly attending school once that's available. I enjoy living with other people for the occasional chats and hangs, but I also do spend quite a bit of time alone to charge my social battery. I'm the kind of person who loves having people around, but not having to chat always. We have a beautiful garden and patio space, lots of indoor plants as well, and a really cozy living room, so I try to use those frequently if we have them. The living space is fairly big and connects with the kitchen, so it's quite easy for everyone to be in that space at once, doing their own thing. I am quite tidy, I really love this apartment and it very much feels like home, so I genuinely enjoy keeping it tidy and caring for it in that way, and I hope that my new roommates will grow to love it as well and feel the same.
In non-covid times, I enjoyed having friends over just for making dinner and hanging out. I have a relatively small bubble, and I'd like for my new roommates to be comfortable communicating about that - just being open and keeping each other in the loop regarding people we're comfortable having in the home - of course, partners are always welcome, my only ask with this is that they spend more time at their own home than they do ours so it doesn't feel like we have extra roommates.

LIVING SPACE: The bedroom is relatively small. It gets the most beautiful evening light, and the closet is very deep. The most this room can fit, I believe, is a double bed. It may fit a queen, but I think it would likely take up most of the space in that case.

Rest of the apartment: As I mentioned, we have a really nice garden and patio space. The inside of the apartment is quite spacious, we have a joint living room/kitchen, and both are pretty big - the kitchen is really nice to cook in because of the space and openness. We also have a very cute tiny balcony (the kind that only fits one person, it's not big enough for a stool or anything), there's lots of light in the common space (the door to the balcony is glass, and there are two other large windows). There's one large bathroom with a tub. Both of the bedrooms are unfurnished, but the rest of the apartment is mostly fully furnished. I have a couch, kitchen table, and a little futon seat, as well as almost all kitchen appliances.

We are two mature, female professionals in our mid to late 30s; looking to share our amazing apartment that has the stunning view of Lake Ontario with an equally mature & like-minded female.

The space is fully furnished & is, therefore, best suited for a minimalist. If you are someone with just a suitcase; this place is ideal for you! (For hygiene reasons a new futton will be provided; not in picture)

The apartment is strictly only for non-smokers & no pets, please.

You are a loner (like us) with minimum friends & minimum late-nights.
You are friendly but like to keep to yourself for the most part.

The building is situated on Jameson Avenue overlooking Lake Ontario which is just a few steps away. Springs & summers are simply amazing for biking, roller-skating, a healthy walk or just lying down with your favourite music or book... ""The Ex"" is just walking distance & during ""normal"" non-Covid times is host to year-round sporting & lifestyle events.

Jameson Avenue is an artery road that takes you directly onto the Lakeshore Boulevard & the Gardiner Expressway highways. Needless to say, we are minutes away from the Liberty Village & the bohemian Roncesvalles village! TTC buses & streetcars are a 5-minute walk at King Street. A convenience store is right around the bend & No Frills & Dollarama are your closest supermarkets... & of course, you do have Metro, Freshco, Shoppers, Canada Post and all other major stores a few blocks away.

Underground or ground-level parking is available (subject to availability / mostly available) for an extra monthly fee.
Laundry is situated at ground level operated by a self-served card system.

Rent includes utilities + high-speed internet. First & last month required. A soft credit check will be needed. Available from September 1st.

My name is Ben!

I own a house on Trinty-Bellwoods Park. I have 1 room in a 5 bedroom house to rent. I also live in the home, so we'ed be roommates!

The house has been renovated and has a new kitchen and bathrooms.

The layout of the house: The first floor is a common space with a living room, reading area, bathroom and large kitchen. The 2nd and 3rd floor have 5 bedrooms and washrooms divided among them. The basement has an area for storage and the laundry facilities (washer and drier are new)! Additionally, there is a lovely back garden with a BBQ and seating area.

What I am looking for is a one year lease for a room that would start September 1st, 2020. It is a large bedroom on the 2nd floor.

About me: I am an easy-going, young professional in Toronto. I travel a lot for work so often, not home (although COVID has changed this for now). I love biking, reading, art and politics. I am queer, so expect you to be understanding of a cosmopolitan life! It's 2020, and you live in Toronto ;)

You can creep me on Instagram: BenjaminBergen

Who lives in the house and what are we looking for:

The house has 4 other young professionals (1Girls and 3 Guy) whom all have 9 to 5 jobs. We are all very respectful of each other's space and keep the house quiet Sunday night to Thursday night. You are welcome to have guests over from Friday to Saturday.

We are looking for another young professional to share the house with who is chill and fun!

Other items included in the price of rent: We have a cleaner that comes once a week to keep the house clean, so you will not need to clean the bathroom or kitchen (unless you use the dishes), internet and utilities. The room is unfurnished.

Sadly no pets, I am allergic.

About the neighbourhood you'd live in: Trinity Bellwoods and the West End of Toronto is a fantastic area full of bars, restaurants and other cultural spaces (Ugh COVID). The house is on the Dundas Streetcar line and is a 15 min walk to downtown or the University of Toronto.

If interested, please write me a little bit about yourself, i.e. what you do for work, how you spend your weekends. Maybe put your social media handle in so I can creep you.

I look forward to hearing from you, and I will be hosting interviews on going.

Best,
Benjamin",craigslist

My name is Nathan and I'm 27 year old male and full time student looking for a room to rent in Toronto or Mississauga. I'm entering my second year of studies at Humber College in radio broadcasting.

My classes are both being done online and in person and the day's I will be at school my schedule is 9-5.

I am looking to rent a room in a house/apartment or basement, ideally, I'd like to share with just one other person and pay between $600-$900 in rent with utilities and internet included. I am clean, quiet and do not smoke, party of drink.

Ideally looking to move in between August 15 and September 1st and stay for one year.


I know the millennial way of doing things is not a lot of communication before meeting and being vague about when you are free playing everything by ear because you don't want to commit to a meeting incase someone better comes along, however, if you contact me please be open for some communication to get to know each other before meeting and please be up front about how the selection process in choosing a roommate will be done (i.e. are you accepting roommates on a first come first serve basis or are you giving everyone an equal opportunity to see the room before deciding)

P.s. why is living a healthy lifestyle now a roommate requirement?",craigslist

RENT: $919.80/month

UTILITIES: Everything included except hydro and internet (which will be split evenly)— $15-20 per person a month for hydro, internet plan TBD but currently it’s $18.33 per person

LOCATION: Koreatown/Christie Pits, Grace St, steps away from Christie station (2 minute walk)

DATE AVAILABLE: September 1, 2020

TERM: Long term (until September 2021), with the option to extend/stay

ACCESS INFO: Not wheelchair accessible. 6 steps are required to come onto the premises then it’s another 6 steps down into the unit. The landlord is responsive via a variety of mediums (text/email/phone). I’m not sure if I can take in anymore pets as I have 2 cats already and don’t know how they’d fare with other cats or animals.

ABOUT THE LIVING SPACE: Steps away from Christie Pits and Christie station. Close to a lot of grocery stores, restaurant/bars, and other amenities. Basement unit in a semi-detached house turned apartment. There’s a private entrance to the unit on the side of the house. The backyard and front porch are free to use for all people living in the building. The ceilings in the unit aren’t that high so if you are 6’+ you’re going to have to duck when coming through doors. Coin laundry on premises that’s best for light loads but there are laundromats nearby. Common area will be semi-furnished. Both rooms will be unfurnished but they both come with open closets in which you can hang and lay things.

LGBTQ+ friendly space as I myself am queer. This is NOT a party home. I’d rather have the place be a chill, relaxing zone in a clean communal living space where we take turns and do chores and cleaning together. I don’t need to be best friends with roommates but occasional low-key hangouts are appreciated in which we can watch TV or play Nintendo Switch together. There must also be respect for alone time and people needing space for themselves and respect for quiet hours. Looking for chill friendly people who are tidy and clean up after themselves and are open about communication and their own needs. No smoking of any substance inside the home but I’m cool if you smoke weed and/or cigarettes.

ABOUT ME: I’m a 22 year old from Vancouver who’s in Toronto for university hoping to relocate here for good. I’m going into my fifth year at UofT double majoring in health studies and sexual diversity studies. I will be staying home more often since classes are online for the most part. One of my jobs is at a movie theatre that’s scheduled to reopen soon that has inconsistent odd hours but I’m mindful when I come home late.

Please feel free to send me a message if interested and would like to see if we’re a good fit. Cheers!",craigslist

Artistic flair, 100 year old character and modern influences collide to create a one of a kind home you absolutely can’t pass up!  Painstakingly renovated with designer touches and artistic influence, this stunning home is a perfect place to raise a family and entertain your friends.

A welcoming and somewhat country-rustic front yard whisks you away from city life to a retreat you can call home.  Antique doors open to original hardwood, character and charm where you can set up your formal dining or sitting room.  Continue to yet another foyer area where you will find your exquisite main floor powder room and jaw dropping HUGE open concept kitchen and living space adorned with a stunning wood burning fireplace, soaring ceilings, pot lights, custom kitchen cabinetry with centre island, high end stainless appliances, granite countertops, built-in office, large walk in pantry, and a beautiful sliding door walking you out to the first of your two private and maintenance-free decks.

Upstairs you will find 3 architecturally stunning bedrooms with too many skylights to mention, old world charm and modern accents.  Your bathroom is simply decadent with a huge soaker jacuzzi tub, glass shower and distinguishing touches like an antique wood shutter from NYC.  But wait, look up!  See the frosted glass wall flanking both sides of the hallway where sunlight from both your bathroom and laundry room can find their way into the hall.  Very cool.  Now look down…. the top two steps leading back downstairs are open and let sunlight flow into your beautiful kitchen.  Peek-a-boo!

We’re not done yet… your master suite is the pièce de résistance with large closets and a sun-filled walkout to a large 2nd floor private balcony.  Beautiful architecture, reclaimed brick exterior and cedar soffits outside are accented by a lush tree canopy where you can enjoy your morning coffee or soak up the afternoon sun.

I love experiencing new things, adventures, art & tech, holistic lifestyle, cuisines, and passionate about travelling/cultures/psychology/self-development.

If needed, move-in could also be arranged at some point in August. We are potentially flexible on the length of the term and could always extend its length if things work out.

The apartment is located close to Queen and Spadina, with easy access to transit, Queen west, the entertainment district, Chinatown, and all downtown universities. The building is well maintained and quiet with all-day concierge service, gym, party room, and a shared patio space. It also features a public and private parking garage with bike storage.

The space is a two-story apartment with a balcony. The unit is furnished and includes a fully stocked kitchen, large living-room, balcony, shared washroom with washer and dryer, and incredible views looking out on Queen St. The room is about 11x11ft with full windows, ample closet space, removable desk, shelf, and a twin bed (which can fold out to a king).

We are a young couple sharing the other room. We are creative, active, and friendly individuals who enjoy cooking, music, film/tv, and making art. We are clean, quiet, and will be respectful of your space and needs. We were both laid-off from work due to the pandemic, but might be returning to our jobs soon.

It is super important to us that you will be very clean and respectful of the space. If you are not willing to share equally in cleaning and maintain your room and the shared areas, please do not inquire. Otherwise we only hope that you are a kind and friendly person, but beyond that we are open to just about everything and everyone.

If you are interested in the room, please respond telling us about yourself. Feel free to also ask any questions you may have. Viewing the place is obviously a little more difficult than normal. We were thinking to say hi, get to know each other, and show the place over zoom, skype, or facetime. Then if things work out we can bring you to the apartment in person provided you wear a mask and gloves.

I am looking for clean, quiet, and responsible person to share my apartment that I love very much. I've lived here for the past 5 years and I really enjoy it.

The house is right across from Dufferin Mall, very close to TTC. It's right next to Dufferin Grove Park. It's fully furnished, including the room (double bed with storage drawers, mattress, 3-drawer chest, walk-in-closet). It is steps away from restaurants, bars and cafes with patios, a YMCA, two supermarkets (Walmart and No Frills).

The large living room has a 43’ TV, two couches, and one armchair. The kitchen is quite spacious with a dining table and stocked with everything a cook might need (I myself love to cook). There is a laundry room that is shared with the upstairs neighbours (a young couple): it has a coin-operated washer and a dryer. There is also a back patio shared with the upstairs tenants.

The rent is $900 (includes all utilities, internet, Netflix on the TV). As the house and the room are completely furnished, you'd only need to bring your personal belongings. Unfortunately, the apartment is not accessible, as you need to go down 7 stairs.

I'm a PhD student (queer cis racialized woman), hoping to finish next year. I’m mostly an extrovert, but I'm also a homebody. I love crafting, baking, and cooking. I am a plant parent. I don't smoke, I only socially drink. I don’t have any pets. I'm quiet, not a partier at all. I'm very clean (this is very important to me) and I love sharing my space with my roommate. I'm very respectful of boundaries, open to communication, but I'm also looking for someone who could share the space with me.

This is a queer and trans-friendly, anti-racist, anti-ableist, feminist household, and I am a union activist. I would love to have someone with a similar outlook to share my space. Socially distant and safe viewing is possible, you will have to wear a mask and have hand sanitizer with you.
